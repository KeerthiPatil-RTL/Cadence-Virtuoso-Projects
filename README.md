# Cadence-Virtuoso-Projects

This repository is a collection of my **Cadence Virtuoso labs and projects** completed in the 
**VLSI System Design Lab (EE 6540L, Fall 2025)** at Wright State University, as well as 
independent extensions like an **8-bit CPU/ALU**.

The work is implemented using **45nm CMOS technology** and demonstrates 
**industry-relevant skills in ASIC/RTL design, digital VLSI, and verification**.

## ðŸ”‘ Skills Demonstrated
- **Cadence Virtuoso + Spectre**: schematic design, simulation, waveform verification  
- **45nm CMOS**: transistor-level digital circuit design and analysis  
- **Circuit Design**: inverters, NAND/NOR, D flip-flops, adders/subtractors, counters, decoders  
- **System-Level Design**: Prime number detector, 8-bit adder/subtractor, 8-bit CPU/ALU  
- **Analysis**: propagation delay, power, energy-delay product (EDP), and optimization
